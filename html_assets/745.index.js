Prescribed area exclusions can vary from region to region. Examples of exclusions are spaces open to below, garages, cold cellars, crawl and reduced height spaces. </p> <p> The footprint of all interior walls and staircases is typically included in the reported Interior Area for a floor. The <span class="iguide-branding">iGUIDE</span> PDF floor plans use color to highlight all included areas. All excluded areas are shown white. </p> <p> <b>Exterior Area</b> is a per floor calculation, made by measuring to the outside surface of the exterior walls, see below for calculation details. </p> <p> <b>Grade</b> is the ground level at the perimeter of the exterior finished surface of a house. A floor is considered to be above grade if its floor level is everywhere above grade. </p> <p> <b>Total Interior Area</b> is the sum of all Interior Areas. </p> <p> <b>Total Excluded Area</b> is the sum of all Excluded Areas. </p> <p> <b>Total Exterior Area</b> is the sum of all Exterior Areas. </p> <p> <b>Unfinished Area</b> is the sum of interior areas of all unfinished rooms (measured to the inside surface of room walls). </p> <p> <b>Finished Area</b> is Exterior Area minus Unfinished Area. Finished Area includes the footprint of interior and exterior walls. </p> <h2><span class="iguide-branding">iGUIDE</span> Exterior Area Calculation</h2> <h3> Exterior Area = [Perimeter Wall Thickness] x [Perimeter Wall Length] + [Interior Area] </h3> <h3>Notes</h3> <ol> <li> <b>Perimeter Wall Thickness</b> is an independent measurement taken from the property, typically, at the main entrance. Considerations are not made for varying wall thickness around the perimeter. </li> <li> <b>Perimeter Wall Length</b> is the sum of lengths of all exterior wall segments on a particular floor. When used to calculate Total Exterior Area Above Grade based on Total Interior Area Above Grade, it is the sum of perimeter wall lengths of all floors above grade. </li> </ol> <h2 class="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2> <p class="disclaimer"> All dimensions and floor areas must be considered approximate and are subject to independent verification. </p> '}}]);
